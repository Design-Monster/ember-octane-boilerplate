<Structural::ExampleParentComponent />
<br>
<br>
This is the Index Route Template.  It is being used to illustrate how I structure my app.  In this template, I pass in data from the route.js file for the index route (or whatever route you're in) - I like to use the route template ONLY to call structural components and pass them the data that they need to render their child components.  So in this file, Structural::ExampleParentComponent is what will be displayed.
